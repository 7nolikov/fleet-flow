## Driving Dreams Since 2019

AutoRent was born from a simple frustration: why is renting a car so complicated? Hidden fees, confusing insurance options, and vehicles that never match the photos. We decided there had to be a better way.

Founded in Barcelona by a team of automotive enthusiasts, AutoRent has grown from a small operation with just 5 vehicles to a fleet of over 20 carefully selected cars. Our mission remains unchanged: **make car rental simple, transparent, and enjoyable**.

## What Makes Us Different

### Transparent Pricing
The price you see is the price you pay. No hidden fees, no surprise charges, no mandatory extras. We include comprehensive insurance and unlimited kilometers as standard.

### Quality Vehicles
Every car in our fleet is **less than 3 years old** and undergoes rigorous maintenance checks between rentals. We don't do worn tires or mysterious warning lights.

### Personal Service
When you book with AutoRent, you're not dealing with a call center. You'll speak directly with our team who know every vehicle inside out and genuinely care about your experience.

### Flexible Booking
Book online through our Cal.com scheduling system and pick up at your convenience. Need to change your dates? No problem—we're humans, not algorithms.
