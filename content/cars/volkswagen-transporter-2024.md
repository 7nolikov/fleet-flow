The Volkswagen Transporter is the go-to choice when you need to move more people or more stuff. This isn't just any van—it's a VW, which means quality, reliability, and driving manners that defy its size.

## Maximum Flexibility

Our Transporter Kombi configuration offers seating for up to 9 passengers with dual sliding doors for easy access. Need to carry cargo instead? The rear seats can be removed or folded to create a cavernous load space.

## Surprising to Drive

Despite its size, the Transporter drives more like a large car than a commercial vehicle. The 2.0L TDI engine provides ample torque for fully loaded journeys, while the refined ride keeps everyone comfortable.

## Perfect For

- **Large groups**: Airport transfers, family reunions, team outings
- **Moving house**: More space than you might expect
- **Sports teams**: Kit, equipment, and the whole squad
- **Surf trips**: Boards, wetsuits, and friends all in one
