The Peugeot 3008 refuses to follow the SUV crowd. Its striking design, with claw-like rear lights and a bold front fascia, ensures you'll stand out from the sea of anonymous crossovers.

## The i-Cockpit Experience

Peugeot's innovative i-Cockpit places a small steering wheel low in your hands with the instruments viewed above it, creating a focused, engaging driving experience unlike anything else on the road.

## Hybrid Efficiency

The plug-in hybrid powertrain delivers impressive electric-only range for around-town driving while the petrol engine ensures worry-free longer journeys. It's the best of both worlds.

## Perfect For

- **Design lovers**: Make a statement with French flair
- **Eco-conscious families**: Hybrid efficiency with SUV practicality
- **Tech enthusiasts**: Cutting-edge cabin technology
- **Coastal road trips**: Elevated driving position for better views
