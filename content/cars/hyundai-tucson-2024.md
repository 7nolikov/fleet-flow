The Hyundai Tucson is proof that mainstream doesn't mean boring. Its "Parametric Dynamics" design language creates dramatic light patterns across its surfaces, ensuring it looks unlike anything else on the road.

## Hybrid Sophistication

The self-charging hybrid system delivers impressive fuel economy—expect around 6L/100km in mixed driving—while the 230hp combined output ensures you never feel short of power when you need it.

## Premium Without the Price

Step inside and you'll find materials and technology that wouldn't look out of place in premium German rivals. Yet the Tucson costs significantly less and comes with Hyundai's industry-leading warranty.

## Perfect For

- **Design-conscious families**: Stand out from the SUV crowd
- **Eco-minded drivers**: Hybrid efficiency without plug-in complexity
- **Road trippers**: Comfortable, capable, and efficient
- **Technology lovers**: Connected features galore
