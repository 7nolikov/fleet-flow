The SEAT Ibiza is proof that affordable doesn't mean boring. With its sharp, athletic design and driver-focused cockpit, the Ibiza brings a dose of excitement to everyday driving.

## Spanish Character, German Engineering

Built on the same platform as the VW Polo but with distinctly Latin flair, the Ibiza offers the best of both worlds. VW Group reliability meets SEAT's passion for driving dynamics, resulting in a car that's as fun to drive as it is practical.

## Ideal For

- **Young drivers**: Sporty looks without the insurance premium
- **Beach trips**: Perfect for exploring the Spanish coast
- **City explorers**: Nimble handling and easy parking
- **Active lifestyles**: Practical enough for sports equipment and luggage
